# HMO-Healthcare-Analysis
Conducted exploratory data analysis, built predictive models, and crafted actionable insights from an 8K+ record healthcare dataset. This project showcases my skills in data analysis and modeling, offering solutions for reducing insurance costs and classifying insurance plans with high accuracy.
Key Highlights:
1. Performed exploratory data analysis of 8K+ records in R and created visualizations using tidyverse and ggplot library to provide actionable insights to HMO reducing insurance cost for next year.
2. Built multi linear regression model to forecast healthcare cost based on demography and lifestyle of individuals achieving mean absolute error of 2.7.
3. Developed 3 different statistical models and performed hyperparameter tuning using grid search technique to predict category of insurance as expensive or non-expensive with 81% accuracy and 85% sensitivity.
